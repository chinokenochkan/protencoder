# pypairwisemap
This is a Python utility to implement pairwise mapping of atomic spacing to represent protein structures in 2D. The method of encoding protein structures in terms of pairwise distances between alpha-carbons on the protein backbone was first implemented in the paper *Generative Modeling for Protein Structures*, which eliminates the need for generative models to learn translational and rotational symmetries.
